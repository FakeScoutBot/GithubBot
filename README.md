## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.20 or higher (for local development).
- **Telegram Bot Token**: You can get one from [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).
- **GitHub Repository**: You'll need admin access to the repository you want to monitor.

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AshokShau/github-telegram-notify.git
    cd github-telegram-notify
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Telegram bot token:
    ```
    TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```
    The server will start on port `3000` by default.

4.  **Expose your local server**:
    To receive webhooks from GitHub, you'll need to expose your local server to the internet. We recommend using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/):
    ```bash
    ngrok http 3000
    ```
    This will give you a public URL that you can use for your GitHub webhook.

### GitHub Webhook Configuration

1.  Go to your GitHub repository's **Settings > Webhooks**.
2.  Click **Add webhook**.
3.  **Payload URL**: Enter the URL from ngrok, followed by `/github?chat_id=YOUR_CHAT_ID`. Replace `YOUR_CHAT_ID` with the ID of the Telegram chat where you want to receive notifications.
4.  **Content type**: Select `application/json`.
5.  **Secret**: (Optional) You can add a webhook secret for added security.
6.  **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**: Select the events you want to be notified about.
7.  Click **Add webhook**.
